    <h1>18.	Seeing the World:    </h1>
    <p>Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit. <br>
      • Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in alphabetical order.<br>
      • Print your array in its original order.<br>
      • Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.<br>
      • Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it.<br>
      • Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.<br>
      • Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it again.<br>
      • Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed.<br>
      • Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.<br>
      • Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.<br>
      • Sort to change your array so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed.
