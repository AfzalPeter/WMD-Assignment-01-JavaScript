    <h1>26.	Alien Colors #2:   </h1>
    <p>
        Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain. <br>
• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien. <br>
• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points. <br>
• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

    </p>

<script> 
var alien_color = prompt("enter alien colour red, green, yellow");

if (alien_color == "green"){
    alert("Player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien");
}
else if (alien_color !== "green") {
    alert("Player just earned 10 points")
    }
else {
    alert("Player failed")
}
